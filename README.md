## Dependencies

This project needs two precompiled binaries:

* [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/#/) to run the commands in `Taskfile.yml`.

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) to build the site. You'll need the _extended_ version, which includes SASS and SCSS compilation support, to build this site.
